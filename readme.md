# tspad

Is an interactive coding environment. You can write Typescript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

- Click any text cell (**including this one**) to edit it
- - You can import it via another. The editor will even give you a suggestion for quick fix.
- - Editor provides autocomplete, type hints, and red squiggles on errors.
- - You can show any React component, string, number, JSON object or anything else by calling the `show` function. This is a function built into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values
- - Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right
- - Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell
- - All of your changes get saved to the file you opened tspad with. So if you ran `npx tspad serve test.json`, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the `test.json` file.
